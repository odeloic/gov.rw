            A brief History About Rwanda
          </h3>
          <p class="content-intro-paragraph">
            For centuries, Rwanda existed as a centralized monarchy under a succession of Tutsi kings from one clan,
            who ruled through cattle chiefs, land chiefs and military chiefs. The king was supreme but the rest of the
            population, Bahutu, Batutsi and Batwa, lived in symbiotic harmony. In 1899, Rwanda became a German colony
            and, in 1919, the system of indirect rule continued with Rwanda as a mandate territory of the League of
            Nations, under Belgium.
          </p>
          <p>
            From 1959, Batutsi were targeted, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and sending almost two million of
            them into exile. The First Republic, under President Gregoire Kayibanda, and the second, under President
            Juvenal Habyarimana, institutionalized discrimination against Batutsi and subjected them to period
            massacres.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Rwandese Alliance for National Unity (RANU) was formed in 1979 by Rwandan refugees in exile, to
            mobilize against divisive politics and genocide ideology, repeated massacres, statelessness and the lack of
            peaceful political exchange. In 1987, RANU became the Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF). On 1 October 1990,
            the RPF launched an armed liberation struggle that ultimately ousted the dictatorship in 1994 and ended the
            genocide which cost more than one million lives – Batutsi and moderate Bahutu who opposed the genocidal
            regime.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Kigali fell to RPA (RPF’s armed wing) on 4 July 1994, RPF formed a Government of National Unity
            headed by President Pasteur Bizimungu, bringing parties that did not participate in the genocide together.
            In 2000, Parliament voted out President Pasteur Bizimungu and RPF appointed then Vice-President and
            Minister of Defence, Major General Paul Kagame as the President of the Republic to lead the coalition
            government. In 2003 President Paul Kagame was elected with landslide majority to serve a term of seven
            years. During those seven years, the country made unprecedented socio-economic and political progress and
            consolidated peace, stability as well as social cohesion among Rwandans. In 2010, President Paul Kagame was
            re-elected to serve a second term and on a platform of rapid development for the transformation of the
            lives of all Rwandans.
