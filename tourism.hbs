            1. Rwanda Development Board (RDB) – Tourism Department
          </h3>
          <p>Nicknamed “The land of a Thousand Hills”, Rwanda is a green undulating landscape of hills, gardens and tea
            plantations. It offers tourists a one of a kind journey - home to one third of the world remaining Mountain
            Gorillas, one third of Africa’s birds’ species, several species of primates, volcanoes, game reserve,
            resorts and islands on the expansive lake Kivu, graceful dancers, artistic crafts and friendly people.

          </p>
          <p>RDB’s Tourism and Conservation Department is mandated to conserve the rich biodiversity of the protected
            areas and to develop sustainable tourism in collaboration with stakeholders for the benefits of the Rwandan
            people. Rwanda aims to be the premier eco-tourism destination on the African continent.</p>
          <p>Rwanda is a thriving, safe country with one of the lowest crime rates in Africa. All major attractions are
            located within 1-5 hour drive from the capital, Kigali. In a short vacation, a tourist can reach volcanoes,
            rainforests, savannah, lakes and the beautiful city of Kigali.</p>

            2. King's Palace Museum- Urukari
          </h3>
          <p>Based in Nyanza, 88 km south of Kigali City, Urukari was the residence of King Mutara III Rudahigwa and
            the Royal Palace that was traditionally built. This Palace offers a detailed look into Rwandan monarchy
            traditional seat. It is an impressive museum and restored to its 19th century state and made entirely with
            traditional materials. Recently, the long horned Traditional cows, known in Kinyarwanda as "Inyambo" were
            also introduced because of the fact that cows form an integral part of Rwandan Culture. On the neighbouring
            hill of Mwima, one can also visit the burial grounds of King Mutara III and his wife Queen Rosalie Gicanda.
