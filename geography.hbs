            Rwanda is a landlocked country situated in central Africa. Also known as ’The Land of a Thousand Hills’,
            Rwanda has five volcanoes, 23 lakes and numerous rivers, some forming the source of the River Nile. The
            country lies 75 miles south of the equator in the Tropic of Capricorn, 880 miles ’as the crow flies’ west
            of the Indian Ocean and 1,250 miles east of the Atlantic Ocean - literally in the heart of Africa. Rwanda
            is bordered by Uganda to the north, Tanzania to the east, Burundi to the south and the Democratic Republic
            of Congo to the west.

            Anyone visiting ’The Land of a Thousand Hills’ is in for a multitude of surprises. The loveliness and
            variety of the landscapes in this ’green country’ is dominated to the north by volcanoes and bordered by
            Lake Kivu to the west.

            In Rwanda the great animals of the wild are protected from poachers and roam free in the vast national
            parks. The Volcanoes National Park in the Virunga volcanic mountains with its high altitude forests is
            world famous for mountain gorillas - timid and passive family oriented giants. The Park is teeming with
            wildlife both large and small, while Lake Kivu to the west offers beautiful beaches, jutting peninsulas and
            an archipelago of islands.
